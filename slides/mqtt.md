# Talking to Things With MQTT

# What is it?
  * Designed in 1999 at IBM. Opensourced in 2010.
  * Goals: Light weight, minimal battery loss, bandwidth.
  * Not actually a message queue.
  * MQTT is not an acronym

# Advantages
 * Websockets
 * Low bandwidth
 * Standardization
 * Well written standard docs (really!)
 * Transmit anything! (JSON, XML, binary, whatever!)

# Alternatives
 * REST (not good)

# Brokers, Clients

# Topics, Pub/Sub

# Advanced Stuff
 * Distinction from "real" message queues.

# Security
 * SSL
 * Shodan and other crawlers.
 * Lax security culture.

# Extras
 * Web client.
 * Mobile client.
 * Server implementations.
 * Commercial providers.
 * MQTT-SN

# Live Demo
